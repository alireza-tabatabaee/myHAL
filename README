# myHAL

I have started programming my own HAL library for the STM32F303VCT microcontroller as a way to deepen my knowledge about ST MCUs and embedded programming.

I was massively influenced by Fastbit Academy's driver development course for this project, so make sure to check out [their driver development Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/).


Until now, I have implemented:
- GPIO
- EXTI

And am planning to implement
- USART/UART
- SPI
- I2C
- Timers

in the forseeable future

And perhaps more complex peripherals such as USB, Ethernet and others after I've learnt more, but who knows what future holds.
